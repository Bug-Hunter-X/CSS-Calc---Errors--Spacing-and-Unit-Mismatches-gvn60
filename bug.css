The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes it causes unexpected issues due to spaces or missing spaces. For example, a common mistake is to add spaces between the values and the operators.  This will lead to incorrect calculations or even syntax errors.

```css
/*Incorrect: Spaces around the + operator*/
width: calc( 100px + 20px ); 

/*Correct: No spaces around the + operator*/
width: calc(100px + 20px);
```
Another issue can occur with unit mismatches. You must use consistent units within the `calc()` expression or unexpected results may occur.

```css
/*Incorrect: Mixing px and %*/
width: calc(50% + 100px);

/*Correct: Consistent unit usage*/
width: calc(50vw + 100px); 
```

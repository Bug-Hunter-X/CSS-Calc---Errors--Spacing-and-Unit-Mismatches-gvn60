To fix spacing errors, remove all unnecessary spaces around operators within the `calc()` expression. For unit mismatches, ensure that all units are consistent across the calculations; it's best to use the same unit throughout the expression for clarity and to prevent unexpected behaviour.

```css
/*Corrected example removing extra space*/
width: calc(100px + 20%);

/*Corrected example with consistent units*/
height: calc(100px - 50px);
```
Always double-check your `calc()` expressions for proper syntax, space usage, and unit consistency to avoid runtime errors and achieve the intended layout results.
